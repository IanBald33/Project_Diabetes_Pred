# Project_Diabetes_Pred
Given a sample Diabetes dataset, develop an algorithm that predicts if a patient has Type 2 Diabetes.


### Objective
Given a sample Diabetes dataset, develop an algorithm that predicts if a patient has Type 2 Diabetes. 
- The avialable data is to simulate the information collected upon a hospital admission. 
- No final coding data will be used. Therefore, no diagnosis codes, medications, or treatments plan data will be used

### Solution Use Case
For use in a production environment, the required features are to be extracted from the Hospital Electronic Health Record. Then the features can be used in one of several scenarios:
- Develop a Tableau report that predicts the Diabetic outcome by utilizing a Python Machine Learning algorithm through TabPy
- Develop a Flask web app, allowing clinicians to determine the overall in-house Diabetic population

For this project, the use case will be to display the most appropriate ML algorithm

### What is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a chronic desease whereby the ailed person has elevated levels of blood glucose, accompanied by disturbed metabolism of fats and proteins. 
There are three types of Diabetes:
1. **Type 1** in which the pancreas does not produce insulin
Not much is known why children, adolescents, and young adults contract this Type 1 Diabetes
2. **Type 2** in which the body cells are resistant to the action of insulin that is being produced and over time the production of insulin progressively decreases
Risk factors for contracting Type 2 are better known. Majority of the cases are due to: age, overweight, obesity, and physical activity. To some extent, smoking and high sugar/fat intake have been linked to Type 2 Diabetes. 
3. **Gestational diabetes** which occurs in pregnancy and can cause some complications during the pregnancy, and at birth and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes in the mother and obesity in the offspring.
Risk factors for Gestational Diabetes follows Type 2 risk factors.

Reading above may not sound like much but Diabetes has morbid outcomes.
- Diabetes causes disability and shortens lives
- Left untreated, it can cause loss of vision and kidney function, heart attacks, strokes, and lower limb amputations
- in 2012 alone, 1.5 million people died from Diabetes world-wide.
- The number of people with Diabetes is increasing. In 1980, there were 108 million world-wide cases. In 2014, there were 422 million cases.
